In my opinion it is the best one I love this movie to death! I grew up watching it as a child and Pierce Brosnan is my number 1 favorite James Bond. GoldenEye is the first film to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that Pierce Brosnan is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. The reason because it is my favorite it is because I feel it is just action, action , action and more action. I never feel bored with it, or it is too over long like some Bond movies are it is fast paced, entertaining and hard core action. The plot is simply and the story never get's bored.

Izabella Scorupco is gorgeous as his sidekick Bond Girl, and Famke Janssen is brilliant as the sexy villain, partnering Sean Bean, whose also excellent.The plot is simple and interesting, and more importantly, the action sequences are truly outstanding. The opening 10-15 minutes is definitely right up there with the best bond openings and again, probably the best.

Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldn't say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.There is nothing clever or witty or re...   \n",
       "2       Really, I could write a scathing review of this turd sandwich, but instead, I'm just going to be making a few observations and points I've deduced.There's just no point in watching these movies anymore. Does any reader out there remember Scary Movie? Remember how it was original with a few comedic elements to it? There was slapstick, some funny lines, it was a pretty forgettable comedy, but it was worth the price of admission. Well, That was the last time this premise was funny. STOP MAKING THESE MOVIES. PLEASE.I could call for a boycott of these pieces of monkey sh*t, but we all know there's going to be a line up of pre pubescent annoying little buggers, spouting crappy one liners like, \"THIS IS SPARTA!\" and, \"IM RICK JAMES BITCH\" so these movies will continue to make some form of monetary gain, considering the production value of this movie looks like it cost about 10 cents to make.Don't see this movie. Don't spend any money on it. Go home, rent Airplane, laugh your ass off, and ...   \n",
       "3       If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen, then you should know that this already will be bad. I'll tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well I've been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money cravi...   \n",

Burping, kicking in the groin and boobs all over the place. Lame. What is wrong with society, that films like this even get made? The parodies were all horrendous, and un-funny. The plot was lackluster at best and the acting was shallow, transparent and really quite unnecessary.Anyone see \"Idiocracy\"? Remember the movie that won all the academy awards in the future? Well this is that movie. I have not seen a more rancid crappy film. \"Date Movie\" was okay, The Scary movies at least had decent plots, but this, this makes \"spoofs\" (if I can be so nice to call it that) for this year 0 for 3, with \"Meet the Spartans\" and \"Superhero Movie\" all falling flat.Well I've wasted even more of my life typing about this sack of cow dung.

       "149995  GoldenEye (1995) is my number 1 personal favorite movie of all time! James Bond 007 action film the best one that was ever made. In my opinion it is the best one I love this movie to death! I grew up watching it as a child and Pierce Brosnan is my number 1 favorite James Bond. GoldenEye is the first film to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that Pierce Brosnan is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. The reason because it is my favorite it is because I feel it is just action, action , action and more action. I never feel bored with it, or it is too over long like some Bond movies are it is fast paced, entertaining and hard core action. The plot is simply and the story never get's bored. It is a beautiful movie, with beautiful direction...   \n",

       "149997  I've given this film a 10, not just because I thoroughly enjoyed it, but because I believe its the best Bond ever made. It was actually the first one I watched as well (I watched it when I was 8 and am now 16.) I have seen the rest of them since and still have this one down as my favourite. Pierce Brosnan is terrific in his first appearance as Bond and I think him and Connery are the best of them all who've stepped into the role so far. Izabella Scorupco is gorgeous as his sidekick Bond Girl, and Famke Janssen is brilliant as the sexy villain, partnering Sean Bean, whose also excellent.The plot is simple and interesting, and more importantly, the action sequences are truly outstanding. The opening 10-15 minutes is definitely right up there with the best bond openings and again, probably the best. The movie never drags like several others have before in which I wish the action would just get going after a while. Other action sequences that are decent include some good aircraft crash...   \n",
       "149998  I absolutely adore this movie. What a comeback for Bond, after the Timothy Dalton Bond's the franchise had been officially declared death by many and no one expected another Bond movie. This movie perfectly sets the mood for the future Bond movies for the 90's and this decade. The action is what makes this movie in a way more of this time. In a way the Bond franchise matured and became a competitor at the box office's again. Still all the 'old' Bond elements are all present once more in this movie and it still stays loyal to the franchise so many grew up with watching.The villains are the best ever in a Bond movie since \"Goldfinger\". Funny because this movie is also the in my opinion the best Bond movie since \"Goldfinger\". I think that tells something about how important the Bond villains always are for Bond movies. Sean Bean is a memorable and worthy nemesis for Bond and Alan Cumming is an excellent and fun 'villain'. But most memorable is Famke Janssen with literally the most dea...   \n",

If you think that when you watch the film you will get sicked by the porn. I mean yes, if your not a porn person who can't bother being by it, than this isn't the film to see. But the thing is, the whole film isn't really about porn. Well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through. The actors played there roles perfect, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, and William H. Macy. The sex scenes, of course are terrific but mainly focus on the character's hype in porn films until there struggles. Excellent film, one of the best! Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+   \n",

A razÃ£o porque Ã© o meu favorito Ã© porque sinto que Ã© apenas aÃ§Ã£o, aÃ§Ã£o, aÃ§Ã£o e mais aÃ§Ã£o. Eu nunca me sinto entediado com isso, ou Ã© muito longo, como em alguns filmes de Bond, Ã© rÃ¡pido, divertido e com uma aÃ§Ã£o central. O enredo Ã© simples e a histÃ³ria nunca fica entediada.

Quase tudo neste trabalho, desde o enredo espirituoso atÃ© Pierce Brosnan como o novo Bond. E eu nÃ£o posso revisar isso sem elogiar Sean Bean como o melhor vilÃ£o da sÃ©rie.   \n",
       "149997  Eu dei 10 a este filme, nÃ£o apenas porque eu gostei muito, mas porque acredito que Ã© o melhor Bond jÃ¡ feito. Na verdade, foi o primeiro que eu assisti (assisti quando tinha 8 e agora tenho 16 anos). Vi o resto deles desde entÃ£o e ainda tenho esse aqui como meu favorito. Pierce Brosnan Ã© Ã³timo em sua primeira apariÃ§Ã£o como Bond, e eu acho que ele e Connery sÃ£o os melhores de todos que entraram no papel atÃ© agora. Izabella Scorupco Ã© linda como sua parceira Bond Girl, e Famke Janssen Ã© brilhante como a vilÃ£ sexy, em parceria com Sean Bean, que tambÃ©m Ã© excelente. A abertura de 10 a 15 minutos Ã© definitivamente lÃ¡ em cima, com as melhores aberturas de bÃ´nus e, novamente, provavelmente a melhor. O filme nunca se arrasta como vÃ¡rios outros antes, no qual eu gostaria que a aÃ§Ã£o continuasse depois de um tempo. Outras seqÃ¼Ãªncias de aÃ§Ã£o decentes incluem algumas boas quedas e explosÃµes de aeronaves em uma antena parabÃ³lica, um grande tiroteio em um arquivo militar...   \n",
       "149998  Eu absolutamente adoro este filme. Que retorno para Bond, depois de Timothy Dalton Bond, a franquia foi oficialmente declarada morte por muitos e ninguÃ©m esperava outro filme de Bond. Este filme define perfeitamente o clima para os futuros filmes de Bond nos anos 90 e nesta dÃ©cada. A aÃ§Ã£o Ã© o que torna este filme de uma maneira mais deste tempo. De certa forma, a franquia Bond amadureceu e tornou-se novamente um concorrente nas bilheterias. Ainda assim, todos os elementos 'antigos' de Bond estÃ£o presentes mais uma vez neste filme e ainda permanece fiel Ã  franquia que muitos cresceram assistindo.VilÃµes sÃ£o os melhores de todos os tempos em um filme de Bond desde \"Goldfinger\". EngraÃ§ado porque esse filme tambÃ©m Ã©, na minha opiniÃ£o, o melhor filme de Bond desde \"Goldfinger\". Eu acho que isso diz algo sobre a importÃ¢ncia dos vilÃµes de Bond para os filmes de Bond. Sean Bean Ã© um inimigo memorÃ¡vel e digno de Bond e Alan Cumming Ã© um excelente e divertido 'vilÃ£o'. Mas o...   \n",

Se vocÃª acha que, quando assiste ao filme, ficarÃ¡ doente pelo pornÃ´. Quero dizer, sim, se vocÃª nÃ£o Ã© uma pessoa pornogrÃ¡fica que nÃ£o pode se incomodar com isso, entÃ£o este nÃ£o Ã© o filme para assistir. Mas o fato Ã© que todo o filme nÃ£o Ã© realmente sobre pornografia. Bem, na metade do filme, trata-se da indÃºstria pornogrÃ¡fica, mas a outra metade Ã© sobre o desenvolvimento dos personagens e as mÃ¡s situaÃ§Ãµes pelas quais esses personagens passam. Os atores interpretaram papÃ©is perfeitos, especialmente Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly e William H. Macy. As cenas de sexo, Ã© claro, sÃ£o fantÃ¡sticas, mas concentram-se principalmente no hype do personagem nos filmes pornogrÃ¡ficos atÃ© que haja dificuldades. Excelente filme, um dos melhores!

An average rating of 5 or 6 stars would be fair, but 1.5 is harsh and totally undeserved.Ring of Terror feels like an episode of The Twilight Zone stretched to an hour. In fact, it's so much like a TV show that one wonders if it might not have been originally created as a pilot.If you're a fan of 1950s horror/suspense series like Thriller, The Veil, One Step Beyond, Tales of Tomorrow, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents, you'll likely find this a pleasant way to spend an hour, as I did.Normally I would only give this film 6 out of 10 stars, but because others have been panning it so unmercifully, I'm giving it a 9.   \n",

This movie, is pure and good. There is just enough action to keep the kids interested, and not so much that you leave the theater with them bouncing off the walls either. It is funny with jokes that everyone can appreciate. I think people have gotten used to so much violence and adult content in our kids movies that they are disappointed when it is missing, like the movie wasn't entertaining enough for the parents. Well, NEWS FLASH.....It's a kids movie, and a perfect one at that. Kids need these kinds of movies, not Spongebob and the like which are more to entertain the parents.   \n",

This film was awesome on so many levels, the acting and writing were fantastic and creepy and I was afraid or and empathetic with the murderer the whole time. What an interesting study on the line between sick and a danger to others, and the line between being a mean girl and being psychotic. Set in a great location, a house full of creepy art, in the winter in Conneticut and with amazing performances from many of my favorite actresses. It actually shocks me that others have given this such a bad review, I loved this movie, I guess it goes to show you everyone will have a different opinion but I say don't miss this film!   \n",

This film makes connections that I've never seen on the big screen but, do see in every day life.The casting was spot on, Hello 12 year-old girls are supposed to be a little annoying. I do wish that more directors would take color into more consideration the way this film does. T The highly stylized sets make the murder scenes more believable because everything is so unbelievable. How can you live in 2016 and not \"get\"a film about social media and accelerationism. #duh Someone explain this to me.   \n",
       "120273  What do you get when you cross Love Story with Star Wars with Blade Runner with Back to the Future with MTV? Love Story 2050, that's what. What a fun movie for the entire family.

The thrills are non-stop in this blockbuster, from its lead off car chase to bike racing stunts to the vantage point of a moving roller coaster to speeding hover-craft--you will be on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The version I saw was only partially in English and I still was glued to the screen. I can't wait to see a version with subtitles. The mega budget special effects are out of this world and highly convincing. The future vision of XBox was hilarious.
